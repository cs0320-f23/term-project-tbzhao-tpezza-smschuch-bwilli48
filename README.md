## Running

### Frontend

For the frontend. We have the all the command functionality found in the previous sprints (loading, viewing, and parsing a CSV; broadband queries with the ACSAPI) as well as one new command desc_search, which takes a description of the required component and runs a queried search for the data on the backend. This in turn highlights the HOLC regions that contain this keyword, which are represented by making them far more opaque that their non-highlighted counterparts.

For running the frontend, please run the following commands:

- `cd frontend` -> moves you to the correct directory
- `npm install` -> installs npm, which we need to run the frontend
- `npm playwright install` -> installs playwright, which runs our tests for us
- `npm run dev` -> runs the server

### Backend
